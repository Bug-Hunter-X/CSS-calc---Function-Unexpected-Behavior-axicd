The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if the calculation is too complex. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10em);` may not produce the expected result if the `em` unit is not properly defined.  Another issue arises when nesting `calc()` expressions, which can become difficult to debug.
