This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The `bug.css` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to inconsistent units and nested calculations within the `calc()` function.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a corrected version with explanations to address the issue.  The problem stems from a misunderstanding of unit consistency and the complexity limits of nested `calc()` expressions. The solution clarifies unit usage and simplifies the calculations to ensure predictable results.
